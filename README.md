# DragonDaily

**Solve DragonFjord puzzles and compete for the fastest solve time every day!**


## Intro
The DragonFjord calendar puzzle is a clever mechanical puzzle where the goal is to arrange puzzle pieces to display any date. There are 31 (days) Ã— 12 (months) x 7 (days of the week)  = 2,604 unique puzzle combinations! Thats enough combinations to solve a different puzzle every day for ~7 years.


## Rules
DragonDaily poses a challenge to solve a DragonFjord puzzle every day in the fastest time. 

Players can drag and drop puzzle peices onto the board and arrange them by rotating and fliping along the vertical or horizontal axis. 

Once the current date is exposed, the timer will stop and the puzzle is solved! If fast enough, your user name and time can appear on the leaderboard.


## Play Every Day

Each player is only allowed **1 attempt** to solve the puzzle for each day (counted as UTC time), and there is a seperate Leadboard for each day.
